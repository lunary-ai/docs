Lunary has powerful observability features that lets you record and analyze your LLM calls.

There are 3 main observability features: analytics, logs and traces.

Analytics and logs are automatically captured as soon as you integrate our SDK.

## Analytics

![Analytics](/media/docs/features/analytics.png)

The following metrics are currently automatically captured:

Metric | Description |
--- | --- |
üí∞ **Costs** | Costs incurred by your LLM models |
üìä **Usage** | Number of LLM calls made & tokens used |
‚è±Ô∏è **Latency** | Average latency of LLM calls and agents |
‚ùó **Errors** | Number of errors encountered by LLM calls and agents |
üë• **Users** | Usage over time of your top users |

## Logs

Lunary allows you to log and inspect your LLM requests and responses.

![Logging](/media/docs/features/logging.png)

Logging is automatic as soon as you integrate our SDK.

## Tracing

Tracing is helpful to debug more complex AI agents and troubleshoot issues.

![Feedback tracking](/media/docs/features/traces.png)

The easiest way to get started with traces is to use our utility wrappers to automatically track your agents and tools.

### Wrapping Agents

By wrapping an agent, input, outputs and errors are automatically tracked.

Any query ran inside the agent will be tied to the agent.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Javascript">
<Alert title="Agents and tools names" icon={<IconRobot />}>
Agents & tools are automatically named from the wrapped function's name. You can change the name by passing a 2nd argument `{ name: "custom-name" }` to the `wrapAgent` and `wrapTool` methods.
</Alert>

```js
// By wrapping your agent's function input, outputs and errors are automatically tracked.
// Sub tools and logs will be tied to the correct agent.
const myAgent = lunary.wrapAgent(async function MyAgent(input) {
  // Your agent custom logic
  // ...
})

await myAgent("Hello, how are you?")
```

If you prefer to use anonymous functions, make sure to pass a name as a 2nd argument to the `wrapAgent` and `wrapTool` methods.

```js
const myAgent = lunary.wrapAgent(
  (input) => {
    // Your agent custom logic
    // ...
  },
  { name: "MyAgent" }
)
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```py
import lunary

@lunary.agent()
def MyAgent(input): # Your agent custom logic # ...
  pass
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Wrapping Chains

Chains are sequences of operations that combine multiple LLM calls, tools, or processing steps into a single workflow. By wrapping chains, you can track the entire sequence of operations as a single unit while still maintaining visibility into each individual step.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Javascript">
```js
const chain = lunary.wrapChain(async function Chain(input) {
  // Your chain custom logic
  // Call LLM
  // Invoke tool
  // etc...
})

await chain('Hello, how are you?')  
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```py
@lunary.chain()
def Chain(input): # Your chain custom logic # ...
  pass
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Wrapping Tools

If your agents use tools, you can wrap them as well to track them.

If a wrapped tool is executed inside a wrapped agent, the tool will be automatically tied to the agent without the need to manually reconcialiate them.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Javascript">
```js
// By wrapping the tool, input, outputs and errors are automatically tracked.
// And sub tools / logs will be tied to the correct agent.
const calculator = lunary.wrapTool(async function Calculator(input) {
  // Your custom logic
  // ...
})

await calculator('1 + 2')
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```py
import lunary

@lunary.tool(name='MySuperTool')
def MyTool(input): # Your tool custom logic # ...
  pass
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
