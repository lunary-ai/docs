Use feedback tracking for: 

- user's reactions to your chatbot's responses directly on the frontend.
- score LLM outputs directly yourself

You can then use this to filter llm calls and fine-tune your own models based on the data.

Feedback tracking can be done in the backend or directly on the frontend if it's easier for you.

## Example of a React Feedback component

You can also use the feedback method to track user reactions to your chatbot's responses directly on the frontend.

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => lunary.trackFeedback(message.id, { thumb: "up" })}>
  👍
</Button>
```

The `trackFeedback` method takes two arguments:

- `runId`: the ID of the message or run you want to track the feedback on.
- `feedback`: an object containing the feedback data. You can use any key/value pair you want.

## Feedback data

You can send any feedback data you want, as long as it's a valid JSON object.

We recommend using the following keys to ensure that data is displayed correctly in the dashboard.

Key | Value | Preview
--- | --- | ---
`thumb` | `up` or `down` | 👍 / 👎
`comment` | arbitrary string | eg. "This is not correct."

## Removing feedback

To remove feedback, simply pass `null` as the feedback data.

```js
lunary.trackFeedback(message.id, { thumb: null })
```
